                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. 
                </div>“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard
                some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
                of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
                Engineer at a VR startup.”

                  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
                Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. 
                </div>“ The staff seem genuinely
                concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
                to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
                above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
                amazing people.”

              Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! 
            </div>“Before joining the
            bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
            wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
            outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
            land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
